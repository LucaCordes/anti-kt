# Anti-kT GIFs

## Description

The following GIFs illustrate the step-by-step jet reconstruction process of the anti-kT algorithm.  
In each frame, the red and blue particles are merged into a new pseudo-particle, shown as a green star.  
The area of each particle is proportional to the logarithm of its transverse momentum.
